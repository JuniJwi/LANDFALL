    Members have a limit of <strong>3 active character slots</strong>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        There is a <strong>3 month cooldown</strong> to character creation.
    </li>
    <li>
        The cooldown can be <strong>waived by spending activity points</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Members can retire a character to free up a slot. There is no limit to the number of retired characters a member may have.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
To <strong>retire a character</strong>, submit a retirement request [here].
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Retiring a character is free.
    </li>
    <li>
        Retirement is diegetic within our plot. While you can retire freely, you need to coordinate it with us first.
    </li>
    <li>
        Retired characters will either be <strong>permanently killed off</strong> or <strong>fundamentally changed</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the latter, you are <strong>permitted to unretire them</strong> after a while if you want to have fun with their new changed form.
    </li>
    <li>
        You cannot un-retire an OC if you are using up all of your active character slots.
    </li>
    <li>
        The cost of ‘un-retirement’ is the same as character creation for activating your character slot– 
        either you need to wait for your 3 month cooldown to be up, or spend activity points to waive the cooldown.
    </li>
    <li>
        Yes… you can technically re-retire and re-un-retire and re-re-retire (and etcetera)  your character. 
        But if we notice a pattern of abuse, we may revoke your retirement rights.
